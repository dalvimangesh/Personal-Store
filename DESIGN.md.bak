# Personal Store - Design Document

## 1. Problem Statement
The user needs a centralized, personal space to store important text snippets (messages, cover letters, links) that can be easily accessed and copied from any device (PC, Mobile). 

**Current Friction:**
- Relying on history in AI tools (Gemini/ChatGPT) to find past generations.
- using chat apps (Slack/WhatsApp) to transfer text between PC and Mobile.
- Repetitive searching for static content.

## 2. Solution Overview
A web-based "Personal Store" application (PWA capable) that acts as a synchronized clipboard and snippet manager.

### Core Value Proposition
"Write once, accessible everywhere."

## 3. Use Cases

### Personal Use Cases
1.  **The "Cover Letter" Scenario**: Store polished versions of cover letters/bios. Open app -> Search "Cover Letter" -> Copy -> Paste into job application.
2.  **The "PC to Mobile" Bridge**: 
    -   *Scenario*: User finds a tweet/link on PC, wants to share on WhatsApp (Mobile).
    -   *Action*: Paste to Personal Store on PC -> Open App on Mobile -> Copy -> Paste in WhatsApp.
3.  **Recurring Messages**: Storing template replies for emails or DMs.
4.  **Quick Reference**: Storing frequent data (Address, WiFi, ID numbers) that isn't sensitive enough for a vault but needs quick access (though we should consider encryption for sensitive data later).
5.  **Drafting Area**: A place to draft a quick thought before moving it elsewhere.

### "Store as a Service" (SaaS) Potential
1.  **Multi-tenancy**: Allow other users to sign up and have their own isolated stores.
2.  **API Access**: Allow developers to fetch their snippets programmatically (e.g., CLI tool to fetch API keys or config snippets).
3.  **Shared Snippets**: Allow users to create "Public Links" for specific snippets to share with others (Read-only).

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  **Dashboard**: List of all snippets.
2.  **Search**: Instant search by title, content, or tags.
3.  **Create/Edit**: Rich text or Plain text editor for snippets.
4.  **Copy Action**: One-click copy to clipboard.
5.  **Categorization**: Tags or Folders (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Drafts").
6.  **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first UI for easy access on phones.

## 5. Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
-   **Frontend**: **Next.js** (React).
    -   *Why*: Excellent performance, easy API integration, good PWA support, industry standard.
-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui**.
    -   *Why*: Rapid UI development, clean aesthetic, mobile-responsive primitives.
-   **Backend / Database**: **Supabase** (PostgreSQL).
    -   *Why*: Built-in Auth, easy Database, Realtime subscriptions (instant sync between devices), and exposes an API automatically if needed.
    -   *Alternative*: SQLite (Turso) + NextAuth. Given the "Service" ambition, Supabase is a strong start.
-   **Authentication**: **Clerk** or **Supabase Auth**.
    -   *Why*: Secure, handles session management across devices easily.

### Data Model

**User**
-   id (UUID)
-   email
-   created_at

**Snippet**
-   id (UUID)
-   user_id (FK -> User.id)
-   title (String)
-   content (Text)
-   tags (Array<String>)
-   is_favorite (Boolean)
-   created_at (Timestamp)
-   updated_at (Timestamp)

## 6. UX/UI Concept

-   **Mobile View**: Bottom navigation (Home, Search, Add). List items have a prominent "Copy" button.
-   **Desktop View**: Sidebar navigation. Grid or List view of snippets.
-   **Quick Add**: A floating action button (FAB) on mobile to quickly paste content from the clipboard.

## 7. Roadmap

1.  **Phase 1: MVP (Personal)**
    -   Setup Next.js project.
    -   Local storage or simple DB implementation.
    -   Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
    -   Copy functionality.
    -   Mobile responsive layout.

2.  **Phase 2: Cloud Sync & Auth**
    -   Integrate Supabase/Clerk.
    -   Secure user data.

3.  **Phase 3: Polish & SaaS features**
    -   Public sharing.
    -   API keys.
    -   Dark mode/Themes.
